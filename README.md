# rAndroid_Appstore
r/Android appstore for apps made by redditors!

Over at https://www.reddit.com/r/Android/comments/50rafp/meta_we_have_an_app_wiki_with_over_700_apps_made/ the mods have asked the community to write them a appstore. In the event that they don't want to manage the team themselves, I'll gladly do it. This repo will serve as the purpose to gather a team, and in turn, write the app. In the event that the r/Android mods wish to manage this project themseleves, I will transfer this repo to them.

##If you are interested in contributing, until the mods set up a more organized form, please send a PR and add your reddit username to this list, and at the least, I will make sure they are aware of it and who wants to help!

##I have begun writing a prototype in this repo, and I welcome anyones contributions or suggestions! Even if you think I did it wrong, feel free to speak up! Contribute as much as you can!
